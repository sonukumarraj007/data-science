# Data Science Projects with Python
[Data Science Projects with Python](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1838551026) is designed to give you practical guidance on industry-standard data analysis and machine learning tools in Python, with the help of realistic data. The course will help you understand how you can use pandas and Matplotlib to critically examine a dataset with summary statistics and graphs, and extract the insights you seek to derive. You will continue to build on your knowledge as you learn how to prepare data and feed it to machine learning algorithms, such as regularized logistic regression and random forest, using the scikit-learn package. You’ll discover how to tune the algorithms to provide the best predictions on new and, unseen data. As you delve into later chapters, you’ll be able to understand the working and output of these algorithms and gain insight into not only the predictive capabilities of the models but also their reasons for making these predictions.
